# Tweet Map

Twitter has become a  very popular and  integral platform to discuss news and ongoing issues in the form of tweets.

                        I have tried to visualise tweets of a particular topic and date on a map of the world to get an idea as to how a topic trends in what part of the world. This visualisation can help us determine how much an issue or any topic matters to a specific geograhical region. For example - coronavirus is a issue that has grappled the entire  world. If we extract the tweets that have the hastag coronavirus of a particular date in may when the virus  is as its peak we get a visualization on the map and find that users from countries such as uk, Italy ,china ,us would have the maximum number of tweets as they were the most affected by it. We can also read the tweets by clicking on the markers that are plotted on the map. We can extract tweets for a region specific issue and visualising that over the specific region can help us understand the sentiment of users of that region and can become a tool towards resolving conflicts. 



Tools used-
  - Tweepy
  - Pandas
  - Folium
  - Plotly
  - Dash

## Usage

First create a virtual env.
To run this we can first install the requirements by `pip install -r requirements.txt`<br/>

To generate a map we can run Tweet_Map.py<br/>
To display it we can use app.py<br/>

##### Future Scope 

we can perform sentiment analysis on the tweets and visualize the positive and negative tweets by different icons to get a more visually enhanced plot that can help us in better understanding in how people are affected by a particular issue.

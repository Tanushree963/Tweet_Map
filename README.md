# Tweet Map
I have tried visualize the most popular tweets by their location by searching for the most trending topic on a specific date or time interval. And the map generated is displayed on the web.We can use this to understand what topic is trending in what part of the world
on the social media.

Tools used-
  - Tweepy
  - Pandas
  - Folium
  - Plotly
  - Dash


#### Preview of Visualization

## Usage

First create a virtual env.
To run this we can first install the requirements by `pip install -r requirements.txt`<br/>

To generate a map we can run Tweet_Map.py<br/>
To display it we can use app.py<br/>

##### Future Scope 

Can perform sentiment analysis on the tweets and visualize the tweets in different colours to get an idea about how the people of different regions feel about a issue.
